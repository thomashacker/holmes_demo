He stepped in front of it. He had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming. He whirled around. His heart was pounding far more furiously than when the book had screamed \u2014 for he had seen not only himself in the mirror, but a whole crowd of people standing right behind him. But the room was empty. Breathing very fast, he turned slowly back to the mirror. There he was, reflected in it, white and scared- looking, and there, reflected behind him, were at least ten others. Harry looked over his shoulder \u2014 but still, no one was there. Or were they all invisible, too? Was he in fact in a room full of invisible people and this mirrors trick was that it reflected them, invisible or not?", "text_to_match": "What did Harry see in the mirror?", "rank": "1", "index_within_document": 4734, "subword_index": null, "start_index": 4667, "end_index": 4826, "sentences_start_index": 4653, "sentences_end_index": 4837, "sentences_character_start_index": 21025, "sentences_character_end_index": 21887, "score": 222.4329318171175, "word_infos": [[65, 70, "single", false, "Matches HARRY directly."], [91, 97, "single", false, "Matches MIRROR directly."], [130, 133, "relation", false, "Matches SEE directly."], [137, 147, "relation", false, "Matches the question word WHAT."], [166, 168, "single", false, "Matches IN directly."], [358, 362, "overlapping_relation", false, "Matches SEE directly."], [380, 382, "overlapping_relation", false, "Matches IN directly."], [387, 393, "overlapping_relation", true, "Matches MIRROR directly."], [407, 412, "overlapping_relation", false, "Matches the question word WHAT."], [524, 530, "relation", false, "Matches MIRROR directly."], [556, 558, "relation", false, "Matches IN directly."], [649, 654, "overlapping_relation", false, "Matches the question word WHAT."], [751, 753, "single", false, "Matches IN directly."], [759, 761, "single", false, "Matches IN directly."], [803, 810, "single", false, "Matches MIRROR directly."]], "answers": [[134, 147], [399, 448], [649, 654]]}
